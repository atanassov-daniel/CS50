65 letters / 14 words * 100 = letters per 100 words
4 sentences / 14 words * 100 = sentences per 100 words
the result from the formula should be rounded to the NEAREST whole number (int)

I will fist try to find the length myself and then maybe use strlen()

214 / 56 * 100 = 382.14
4 / 56 * 100 = 7.14

a letter = [A-Za-z]
any sequence of characters separated by spaces should count as a word
any occurrence of a period, exclamation point, or question mark indicates the end of a sentence
